# The Rainchecked Web App (version 1.0.0)

This project was developed by me to create a hub of features that I find useful such as weather forecasts for my city or any city I choose, get updated with the latest news and in v1.0.1 to add productivity tools such as Note taking feature and a Savings tracker dashboard.

## Motivation

I always wanted an application that I can actually use in my day-to-day life and not just an application to decorate my portfolio. So, I took the chance to use my knowledge of HTML, CSS and React JS to build one.

## How It Works

Rainchecked is a responsive web application that displays weather forecast and world news through external APIs with a great UI.
The app consists of multiple components having unique utilities. Major components in this case are:
- NavMenu for toggling themes, selecting a city or exiting the application.
- UIRenderer for displaying inner components in one container using flex and grid layouts.
- Weather displays all contents for weather forecast and sends requests to the worldweatheronline API.
- News displays latest world news and sends requests to NYTimes API.
